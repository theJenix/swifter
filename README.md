Swifter
=======

A collection of Swift files to extend core functionality and implement common use cases and patterns.

Currently, it doesn't look like it is easy to create an external Framework or library with Swift files.  For now, use this code library
by adding the src/Swifter file (or any individual files) directly to your Xcode project.
